## 2026-08-11 — Alpine base, and `7zz` as the single extraction tool

**Decision:** `python:3.13-alpine` runtime (`node:22-alpine` builder), with the `7zip` package
(7-Zip proper, `7zz`) as the only archive tool. See `DESIGN.md` §11 and §11.1.

This deliberately departs from the sibling projects (`filament-bridge`, `labelforge`,
`partfolder3d`), which all run `python:*-slim` on Debian. Consistency lost to "smallest secure
image that does this job" on request.

**Why Alpine.** ~3× smaller with a much smaller installed package set, which is most of the CVE
surface. The historical objections are largely spent: musl gained DNS TCP fallback in 1.2.4
(Alpine 3.19+), and every dependency we need — `cryptography`, `pydantic-core`, `argon2-cffi` —
publishes `musllinux` wheels, so no Rust toolchain lands in the runtime image.

**Rejected: Debian slim.** Larger, and its archive story is worse — `unrar` is non-free and
`unrar-free` historically cannot read RAR5, which is what scene releases actually ship.

**Rejected: distroless / Chainguard.** Lower CVE counts, but we need `lftp`, `ssh`, and `7zz`
plus a shell for the PUID/PGID entrypoint. Fighting those images to install arbitrary packages
buys little over Alpine.

**`7zz` instead of `unrar` + `p7zip`.** 7-Zip 21.07+ extracts RAR and RAR5 natively, so one
binary covers rar / rar5 / zip / 7z / tar / gz / bz2 / xz — no non-free repo to enable, no
second tool to keep current. Its RAR decoder derives from the unRAR source, whose licence
forbids building a RAR-compatible *compressor*; we only extract, so this is a footnote rather
than a constraint.

**The base image is the smaller half of "secure."** The rest is runtime posture and lives in
compose: non-root, `cap_drop: ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, read-only rootfs, digest-pinned base,
and credentials confined to a `/run` tmpfs at mode 0600 (§11.1).

## 2026-08-11 — Admission-control scheduler; allocations are never re-shaped

**Decision:** bandwidth is handed out at admission and fixed for a job's lifetime. Site-level
`max_bandwidth` and `max_concurrent_transfers`, a fast lane for small items, and a sortable
rank for priority. Full algorithm and worked examples in `DESIGN.md` §4.5.

**The insight.** `lftp -c` exits with its transfer and offers no control channel, so a running
job cannot be retuned. Earlier drafts treated that as a defect to work around — first by
dividing by max concurrency, then by dividing by active jobs at spawn. Both were workarounds
for a constraint that a different scheduler simply never encounters. Allocating at admission
and never re-shaping turns the limitation into the design.

**Rejected: re-shaping running jobs.** Requires the control channel we don't have. The
stdin-held-open experiment (§4.5) might supply one, but it is unverified and nothing may depend
on it.

**Rejected: dividing by `max_concurrent`.** Wastes the most throughput in the commonest case —
one large download at a time.

**Rejected: an unmetered fast lane.** Queue 300 small files and it saturates the uplink at its
concurrency cap, starving the rate-limited main lane and blowing past the ceiling precisely
when the ceiling matters. The reserve is carved off `B` instead, so the total stays bounded.

**Accepted cost.** A job admitted at B/2 keeps B/2 after its partner finishes, leaving half the
pipe idle with nothing to claim it (§15.4).

**Fast lane rationale.** Not about small files being special — about head-of-line blocking. A
3 MB `.nfo` arriving while a 40 GB release holds the whole ceiling would otherwise wait an hour
to move a file it could have finished alongside in under a second.

**Site-level, not per-queue.** Parallelism and bandwidth multiply into a single host-wide
connection ceiling; letting each queue raise them independently makes that ceiling
unenforceable. A queue governs *what* and *where*, never *how fast*.

## 2026-08-11 — `sync` mode deferred to phase 2; hardlink pickup dir is what makes deletion safe

**Decision:** v1 ships `copy` and `move`. `sync` — propagating local deletes back to the remote
— is designed in full now (`DESIGN.md` §7) and built in phase 2.

**Why remote deletion is safe here at all.** The torrent client hardlinks completed files into a
separate pickup directory, and lftpweb points at the pickup dir, never at the torrent data
directory. Unlinking there drops one link; the seeding torrent keeps its own, so the data, the
seed, and the ratio survive. This is a property of *the directory you point at*, not of
lftpweb — hence the misconfiguration warning in §7.1 and inline at the mode selector.

**Rejected: torrent-client API gating.** The usual correct answer (ask qBittorrent/rTorrent
whether the seed goal is met before deleting). Unnecessary here — the hardlink already encodes
the answer — and it would pull a whole integration in for nothing.

**Rejected: minimum-file-age gating.** A poor proxy: it proves neither that seeding finished nor
that the download completed. Here it would gate an operation that is already safe, adding
friction and buying nothing.

**Rejected: a count-based circuit breaker.** This is the subtle one. Sonarr/Radarr import by
*moving* files out, so a local file disappearing is the normal end state of every successful
import — deletes are **routine, not anomalous**. A "more than N deletes is suspicious" breaker
false-positives on every bulk import. Anomaly detection is therefore unavailable as a
safeguard, which concentrates the entire safety load on the mount sentinel gate (§15.1). That
concentration is the reason `sync` defers: it gets built after the surrounding machinery is
proven, not alongside it.

**What defers with it:** the sentinel gate, grace period / `item.first_missing_at`, dry-run, and
the rate-based backstop. **What does not:** `move` deletes too, so verification-before-delete,
deletes through our own asyncssh path (§7.4), and the `event` audit trail are all v1.

## 2026-08-11 — `code-checkin-and-pr` deferred until the first GitHub push

**Decision:** do not adopt `code-checkin-and-pr` yet; follow two of its conventions voluntarily.

Every rule in that standard binds to a remote — protected `main`, `dev → main` PRs, seven
required CI checks, image publishing with registry retention. lftpweb has no remote and no CI,
so a `standards.md` row claiming adoption would assert conformance that cannot exist. The
standards index explicitly warns against exactly this ("a clean-looking row that lies").

Instead: commit-prefix conventions (`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:`), no
`Co-authored-by:` trailers, and the `dev` / `main` branch shape are followed from commit one,
so the history is already conformant when the standard is adopted for real. That adoption
should land in the same change that adds the remote and CI, re-pinning the row to the
then-current version.

## 2026-08-11 — Bootstrap adoption done in-session, not via a handoff prompt

**Decision:** the `handoff-prompt-workflow` adoption commit is the one task exempt from the
workflow it installs.

The standard's v2.0.0 threshold pushes any edit beyond ~1–2 files into a `prompts/` file
executed by a spawned subagent. This scaffolding touched six files, so by the letter it wanted
a prompt — but that prompt would have had to live in the `prompts/` directory it was itself
creating, inside a git repo that did not yet exist, and the mandated
`git status --porcelain` working-tree check had no tree to inspect.

Rejected alternative: `git init` first, then write the prompt and spawn an agent for the rest.
Workable, but it splits an atomic, fully-prescribed checklist across two contexts for no gain —
the standard's own adoption section *is* the spec, so a fresh context adds nothing.

Scope of the exemption is exactly one commit. Every task after it goes through the workflow.

## 2026-08-11 — lftp is a transfer engine, not a status API

**Decision:** derive transfer progress from the filesystem — local bytes on disk versus known
remote size — and use lftp purely to move bytes. One short-lived lftp process per transfer,
driven over plain pipes. See `DESIGN.md` §1.3 and §4.

**Rejected alternative — SeedSync's approach:** one long-lived interactive lftp per path-pair
over a pexpect PTY, with all transfer state reconstructed by polling `jobs -v` every 0.5 s and
regex-parsing lftp's human-readable verbose output.

**Why rejected.** That parser is ~15 interlocking regexes plus an order-dependent line
dispatcher, and it must survive readline's ANSI/bracketed-paste escapes, PTY line wrapping when
`COLUMNS` isn't honored, and lftp's inconsistent progress grammar (in `` `f' at 2976 (12%) ``
the number is *not* the local size and the percentage is *not* the local percentage). SeedSync's
maintainer records it in fork issue #294 as "the most fragile part of the codebase… the root
cause remains", closed as "do nothing for now". Sharing one process per pair also means one
parse failure or pexpect timeout degrades *every* transfer on that pair, and stopping a job
carries an acknowledged kill-wrong-job race because ids can shift between the status read and
the kill.

**What this buys.** Liveness becomes an exit code, stopping becomes a SIGTERM to one PID,
failures are contained to one transfer, and per-file progress covers the whole tree rather than
whichever files lftp happens to mention. ETA is computed and smoothed uniformly by us, fixing
the directory-ETA problem lftp causes by never emitting an ETA on a mirror header.

**Cost accepted.** Two lftp on-disk conventions must be understood instead:
`<file>.lftp-pget-status` sidecars (sparse-file accounting) and the `xfer:use-temp-file` /
`*.lftp` suffix. Both are short, stable, machine-oriented formats, unlike the verbose output,
which is formatted for humans and has never been a stable interface. If either changed,
progress degrades to raw size (still monotonic) and completion is unaffected, because
completion is the exit code.

**Status:** recorded from `DESIGN.md`, which is still under review. If §1.3 is overturned in
review, supersede this entry rather than editing it.
