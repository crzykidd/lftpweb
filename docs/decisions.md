# Decision record

Non-obvious decisions for lftpweb — approach changes, rejected alternatives, workarounds.
Newest at top. Per the `handoff-prompt-workflow` standard, sessions append here rather than
leaving the reasoning only in a commit message.

## 2026-08-11 — `code-checkin-and-pr` deferred until the first GitHub push

**Decision:** do not adopt `code-checkin-and-pr` yet; follow two of its conventions voluntarily.

Every rule in that standard binds to a remote — protected `main`, `dev → main` PRs, seven
required CI checks, image publishing with registry retention. lftpweb has no remote and no CI,
so a `standards.md` row claiming adoption would assert conformance that cannot exist. The
standards index explicitly warns against exactly this ("a clean-looking row that lies").

Instead: commit-prefix conventions (`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` / `docs:`), no
`Co-authored-by:` trailers, and the `dev` / `main` branch shape are followed from commit one,
so the history is already conformant when the standard is adopted for real. That adoption
should land in the same change that adds the remote and CI, re-pinning the row to the
then-current version.

## 2026-08-11 — Bootstrap adoption done in-session, not via a handoff prompt

**Decision:** the `handoff-prompt-workflow` adoption commit is the one task exempt from the
workflow it installs.

The standard's v2.0.0 threshold pushes any edit beyond ~1–2 files into a `prompts/` file
executed by a spawned subagent. This scaffolding touched six files, so by the letter it wanted
a prompt — but that prompt would have had to live in the `prompts/` directory it was itself
creating, inside a git repo that did not yet exist, and the mandated
`git status --porcelain` working-tree check had no tree to inspect.

Rejected alternative: `git init` first, then write the prompt and spawn an agent for the rest.
Workable, but it splits an atomic, fully-prescribed checklist across two contexts for no gain —
the standard's own adoption section *is* the spec, so a fresh context adds nothing.

Scope of the exemption is exactly one commit. Every task after it goes through the workflow.

## 2026-08-11 — lftp is a transfer engine, not a status API

**Decision:** derive transfer progress from the filesystem — local bytes on disk versus known
remote size — and use lftp purely to move bytes. One short-lived lftp process per transfer,
driven over plain pipes. See `DESIGN.md` §1.3 and §4.

**Rejected alternative — SeedSync's approach:** one long-lived interactive lftp per path-pair
over a pexpect PTY, with all transfer state reconstructed by polling `jobs -v` every 0.5 s and
regex-parsing lftp's human-readable verbose output.

**Why rejected.** That parser is ~15 interlocking regexes plus an order-dependent line
dispatcher, and it must survive readline's ANSI/bracketed-paste escapes, PTY line wrapping when
`COLUMNS` isn't honored, and lftp's inconsistent progress grammar (in `` `f' at 2976 (12%) ``
the number is *not* the local size and the percentage is *not* the local percentage). SeedSync's
maintainer records it in fork issue #294 as "the most fragile part of the codebase… the root
cause remains", closed as "do nothing for now". Sharing one process per pair also means one
parse failure or pexpect timeout degrades *every* transfer on that pair, and stopping a job
carries an acknowledged kill-wrong-job race because ids can shift between the status read and
the kill.

**What this buys.** Liveness becomes an exit code, stopping becomes a SIGTERM to one PID,
failures are contained to one transfer, and per-file progress covers the whole tree rather than
whichever files lftp happens to mention. ETA is computed and smoothed uniformly by us, fixing
the directory-ETA problem lftp causes by never emitting an ETA on a mirror header.

**Cost accepted.** Two lftp on-disk conventions must be understood instead:
`<file>.lftp-pget-status` sidecars (sparse-file accounting) and the `xfer:use-temp-file` /
`*.lftp` suffix. Both are short, stable, machine-oriented formats, unlike the verbose output,
which is formatted for humans and has never been a stable interface. If either changed,
progress degrades to raw size (still monotonic) and completion is unaffected, because
completion is the exit code.

**Status:** recorded from `DESIGN.md`, which is still under review. If §1.3 is overturned in
review, supersede this entry rather than editing it.
